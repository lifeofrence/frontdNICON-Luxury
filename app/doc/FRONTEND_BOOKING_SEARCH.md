## Usage

### For Users
1. Click "Advanced Search" button
2. Fill in any combination of search criteria
3. Click "Search" to apply filters
4. View results with active filters displayed
5. Click "Clear Filters" to reset

### For Developers
The search modal can be reused in other components:

```tsx
import { BookingSearchModal, BookingSearchFilters } from './booking-search-modal'

const [isSearchOpen, setIsSearchOpen] = useState(false)

const handleSearch = (filters: BookingSearchFilters) => {
  // Handle search with filters
}

<BookingSearchModal
  open={isSearchOpen}
  setOpen={setIsSearchOpen}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
  initialFilters={{}} // Optional initial values
/>
```

## API Integration

The frontend now sends all search parameters to:
```
GET /api/admin/bookings?name=John&status=confirmed&room_type=Deluxe&page=1
```

All parameters are optional and can be combined for precise filtering.

## Testing

To test the search functionality:
1. Navigate to `/admin/bookings`
2. Click "Advanced Search"
3. Try different filter combinations:
   - Search by guest name
   - Filter by booking status
   - Search by room number
   - Combine multiple filters
4. Verify results update correctly
5. Test "Clear Filters" functionality
6. Check URL updates with search parameters

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add date range filters (check_in_from, check_out_to)
- Save favorite search filters
- Export filtered results
- Quick filter presets (e.g., "Check-ins Today", "Pending Bookings")
- Search history
